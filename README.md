minecraft-2b
============

finally I realize that github is not the right place to host this 2b stuff.

### Rules

Rule No.1 : __NEVER Play Alone.__

2. NEVER kill your buddies, (with lava or something)
3. NEVER play it for two consecutive days.
4. Play at most __ONCE__ a week.
5. Do not use creative mode.

### Guidelines

1. Use your own login.
2. Make the path easy to recognize. (so that you can find the way back)
3. Do not destroy the nature.
4. When exploring the world, always stay together and follow the leader (usually can be identified by a yellow hat).
5. The ultimate goal is to have fun, do not try to build any fancy stuff that's out of your ability.
